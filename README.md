I want to share with you a small adjustment I made for my project with the bar chart in Chart.JS library.  
  
The result I wanted to achieve was to be able to filter specific bars from the chart.  
  
This is the original state I got from ChartJS legend:  
![](images/1.gif =50x50)
<img src="images/1.gif" width="500" height="350" />
  
The result I wanted:  
<img src="images/2.gif" width="500" height="350" />
